## Directions

1. Create a new program.  Use a comment at the beginning of the program to provide your first and last name.
2. Take in four integer values.  Create a variable for each value, title the variables: num1, num2, etc.
3. The intent is to print an accurate average of the four values, using casting.  Print out a demonstration of each of these scenarios for calculating the average of the four values:
	* No casting is used.  The average printed is an int.
	* The casting occurs too late and the double printed is inaccurate.
	* Casting is used correctly and a correct average is printed.


Your program should work, such that an input of:

	1
	2
	3
	4

Will produce an output of:

	No casting is used.  The average printed is an int: 4
	The casting occurs too late and the double printed is inaccurate: 4.0
	Casting is used correctly and a correct average is printed: 4.5
