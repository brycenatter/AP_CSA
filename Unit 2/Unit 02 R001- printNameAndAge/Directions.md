## Directions

Create a program called Main.

Within this program:

* Read a string and integer from the user
* Write a method called printNameAndAge that accepts a name and a person's age as parameters and prints that in a sentence.

For example, the call:
`printNameAndAge ("Anne", 21);`
will produce the following output: `Anne is 21 years old` when given the following input
`Anne 21`

In the main method, call printNameAndAge.
