## Directions

Create a program called Main.

1. Read five integers (w,x,y,z, q)
2. In the main method, create two point objects at position (w,x) and position (y,z) in the coordinate space.
3. Create a method called manipulatePoint that:
4. Accepts a point and an int a as parameters
5. Translates the point by (int a, int a)
6. Returns the translated point
7. In the main method, call the manipulatePoint method and update the value of your first point.
8. Print the updated first point.
9. In the main method, print true if the two point objects are equal, print false otherwise.
