## Directions

Create a program that computes the total bill due to a restaurant and prints the information listed below. Create variables of the appropriate type to compute, as efficiently as possible, the total bill.

#### Use the following data:

* tip: 18%
* tax: 6%
* meal 1 = $7.99
* meal 2 = $12.43
* meal 3 = $11.23

#### **FOUR** important tips for you as you perform calculations:


* Tip 1: Tax is calculated based on the meal total (you don't tax the tip!)

* Tip 2: The tip is calculated based on the meal total - BEFORE tax

* Tip 3: When you calculate the totals, the results will not be in dollars and cents format (there will be too many decimal places). Don't worry about this, it's a more advanced skill we will tackle later in the year.

* Tip 4: use double primitive types for your variables.

#### Print the following statements (NOTE: there is a period at the end of each statement)

1. The total cost of our food is _____.

2. The total tip is __________ and the total tax is __________ .

3.  The total bill is __________ and I think that's a bargain for such high quality food!
