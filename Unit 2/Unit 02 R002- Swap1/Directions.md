## Directions

Modify the program called Main to accomplish the following:

1. Create a method called swap which accepts two integers, swaps the values of those two integers, and then prints those two integers.
	* Example: If p = 1 and q = 5, the method will change the value of p = 5 and q = 1 and then will print those two values.

2. Call the swap method on line six of your program (in the main method)
