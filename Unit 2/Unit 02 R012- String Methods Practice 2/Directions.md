## Directions

Create a program called Main. Within this program:

* Read a string and two integers.

* Print out the following string:

The substring of (str) from (start) to (end) is (substring from start to end, **inclusive**)

Sample output:

`The substring of lolwut from 2 to 4 inclusive is lwu`

PLEASE NOTE that we are counting the end index in our output!

	lolwut
	012345
