## Directions

Create a program called Main.

1. Read two integers and two doubles (w, x, y, z)
2. Create two Integer objects using w, x
create two Double objects using y, z
3. Print the value of each Integer and Double object using the `toString()` method.
4. Use the Integer `compareTo()` method to compare the first Integer to the second Integer and print the result


Example

Input:

	1
	2
	3.0
	4.0
Output:

	The first Integer is equal to 1
	The second Integer is equal to 2
	The first Double is equal to 3.0
	The second Double is equal to 4.0
	Result of Integer comparison -1
