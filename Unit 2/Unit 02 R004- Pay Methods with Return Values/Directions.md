## Directions

Create a program called Main. You will be calculating pay. Within this program:

* Read an integer (number of hours) and a double (pay/hour)
* Create appropriate variables
* Write a method called calculatePay that accepts an integer and a double as parameters and calculates the pay of a programmer for a given day. The method should return how much money to pay the programmer. For example, the call calculatePay (6, 5.50) should return 33.0
* Call the method calcluatePay in Main
* Assign the results of the method call to a variable and print that variable in a sentence. 

Example:<br>
`Your total pay for today is $50.0`

**NOTE: don't worry that your response is not in "dollar/cent" format.**
