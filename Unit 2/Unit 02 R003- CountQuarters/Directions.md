## Directions

Create a program called Main.

Within this program:

* Read an integer from the user
* Write a method called countQuarters that accepts an int representing a number of cents as a parameter and returns the number of quarter coins represented by that many cents. Don't count any whole dollars, because those would be dispensed as dollar bills. For example, countQuarters (64) would return 2, because 64 cents is equivalent to two quarters with 14 cents left over. A call of countQuarters (1278) would return 3, because after the 12 dollars are taken out, 3 quarters remain in the 78 cents that are left.
* Call the method countQuarters in Main
* Assign the results of the method call to a variable and print that variable in a sentence. 

Example:<br>
`There are 2 quarters in the integer 64`
