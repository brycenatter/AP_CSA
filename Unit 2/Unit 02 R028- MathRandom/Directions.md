## Directions

Write a program called main.

1. Read two integers, x and y.
2. Create appropriate variables.
3. Create a dice method that simulates the role of a single dice and returns the value.
1. In the main method, call dice and print the result. `The result of a role of one dice is: [result]`
4. Create a twoDice method that simulates the role of two dice, adds the result of the roll together and returns that value.  This method should call the disc method in item # 3.
5. In the main method call twoDice and print the result. `The result of a role of two dice is: [result]`
6. Create a randomNumGenerator method that takes two integers as parameters and selects a random number with the range. **You can make the assumption that the first random number is SMALLER than the second random number**
7. In the main method, call randomNumGenerator and print the result. `The random number between x and y is: [result]`

Example

Input:
	
	2
	15
Output:
		
	The result of a role of one dice is: 5
	The result of a role of two dice is: 9
	The random number between 2 and 15 is: 12
