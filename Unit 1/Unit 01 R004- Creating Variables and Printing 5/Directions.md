# Creating Variables and Printing 5

#### For you to do:

* Create a String variable called "name" and set it to "Chen" (We cover strings in Unit 2, so this is a preview. `String name = “Chen”;`
* Create an integer variable called "age" and set it to 50
* Create an integer variable called "iq" and set it to the value of age (do NOT use ' = 50')
* Print the value of name
* Print the value of age without skipping a new line
* Print the value of iq
